# Convolution Algorithms in C++ with OpenCV

This repository contains C++ programs demonstrating basic image processing algorithms using **OpenCV**. The focus is on implementing **convolution filters**, color and grayscale transformations, and basic image analysis from scratch.

## Features

1. **Grayscale and Color Image Convolution**  
   - Apply custom 3x3 kernels to grayscale and RGB images.  
   - Examples included:
     - Blur filter
     - Edge detection (Sobel filter)

2. **Image Inversion and Grayscale Conversion**  
   - Invert colors of an image.  
   - Convert an RGB image to grayscale manually.

3. **Image Inspection**  
   - Print image dimensions, type, and sample pixel values for analysis.
